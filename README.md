# code-quiz
For this project I created a timed coding quiz. It has four main parts to it, the intro screen, the actual quiz, the screen to enter your highscore, and a screen that shows you a list of highscores from highest to lowest. 
# Features

* once you are finished with the test you are presented with your score which is how much time you have left on the clock and you are able to save your score by entering in your initials in the input and submitting it

* once you submit your highscore you are taken to the highscore screen which gives an ordered list of highscores from high to low, taken from the scores that were set to the local storage when they were submitted. from here you can go back to the home screen with the "Go Back" button or you can also clear those scores out with the "clear highscores" button.
